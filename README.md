# Molecule-calculator

This lab was a part of the course DD1320 Applied Computer Science 6.0 credits.

The assignment was to write a program that calculates the weight of any molecule the user wants, as long as the molecule exists and is written correctly. 
The program will also draw a syntax tree of the molecule. 

When running the main file, simply write a molecule in the terminal and click enter. All the files are needed for the program to work.

The instructions for this lab were written in Swedish, thus also the program.
